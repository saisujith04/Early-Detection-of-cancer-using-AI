# Early-Detection-of-cancer-using-AI
This project uses a CNN to analyze histopathological images for early breast cancer detection, including **ductal, lobular, and mucinous carcinoma**. By leveraging deep learning with ADAM, SGD, and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, it enhances accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports faster diagnosis, improving patient outcomes.
